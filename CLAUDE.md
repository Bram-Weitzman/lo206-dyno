# CLAUDE.md — Dev context for Claude Code

## Project purpose

Build a hybrid hydraulic/mechanical dynamometer for the Briggs & Stratton
LO206 kart engine, controlled by a Raspberry Pi running OpenPLC. We are
**sim-first**: a Python simulator stands in for the engine + load so the
entire control system can be validated before any hardware is bought.

## Current phase

**Phase 0 — scaffolding and simulator bring-up.** No hardware exists yet.
The immediate goals are: lock the Modbus register map, implement the torque
curve interpolation, and get the Modbus server talking to OpenPLC.

**Hydraulic circuit decisions locked (May 2026):**
- Pump: 1.52 cu.in. gear pump, Princess Auto Item 8375446, 2.1:1 belt reduction
- Operating pressure range: 500–1,100 PSI normal, 1,200 PSI software trip,
  1,500 PSI mechanical relief
- Back-pressure baseline: ~200 PSI (return-line relief valve, Item 8688939)
- These values are reflected in `engine_sim.py` constants and `docs/bom.md`
- Observed RPM floor at max braking (100% valve): ~3,135 RPM in the updated
  simulator, down from ~4,236 RPM under the original 12.0 pump-load gain.

## Stack

- **Simulator**: Python 3.12 (pymodbus, numpy, pytest), venv at `/opt/dyno-venv`
- **PLC**: OpenPLC runtime, IEC 61131-3 Structured Text
- **Transport**: Modbus TCP (port 502)
- **Dashboard**: Next.js (not scaffolded yet)
- **Persistence**: SQLite for local runs, PostgreSQL if/when we centralize

## Critical design principle

**The control logic is I/O-agnostic. The Modbus register map is the contract.**
The PLC reads sensor values and writes a valve command over Modbus. It does not
know or care whether the other end is the Python simulator or real hardware.
Never branch the control logic on "sim vs real". If the sim and the hardware
disagree, the register map (`plc/register_map.md`) is the source of truth and
must be changed *first*, deliberately, before either side.

## Before writing any code

1. **Read `plc/register_map.md` first.** If your change touches any value that
   crosses the Modbus boundary, the register map must be updated *before* the
   code on either side.
2. Confirm which side *owns* the register you are touching (PLC-writes vs
   sim-writes). Owners are documented in the register map.
3. Keep the control logic free of sim-specific assumptions.
4. Run `pytest` in `simulator/` before committing simulator changes.

## Known open questions

- **Valve driver**: 0-10V amp card vs PWM + MOSFET — undecided. See
  `docs/sim_to_real.md`.
- **Engine inertia / valve lag constants**: placeholders in `engine_sim.py`;
  need real values once we can bench-measure the engine and valve.
- **Torque curve fidelity**: we currently use published B&S Black Slide data.
  Other slide configs are not yet digitized (see `docs/bom.md`).
- **Safety thresholds**: RPM > 6500 remains a first-guess — confirm against
  engine builder recommendations once on real hardware. PSI > 1200 software
  trip is now a confirmed hardware decision: system relief valve (Princess
  Auto Item 8688947) is set at 1,500 PSI; 1,200 PSI software trip fires first.
  Back-pressure baseline is ~200 PSI (return-line relief, Item 8688939).
  Review both thresholds after first live runs.
- **AFR channel (30006)**: reserved but unpopulated — wideband O2 is a Phase 2
  hardware addition.
- **Dashboard data path**: does the dashboard read Modbus directly, or through
  a logging service writing to SQLite/Postgres? Undecided.

## Git author note

**Confirm/replace** these if a different identity should own the commits.

## Current session state

Last worked on: 2026-05-21 — end-to-end integration validated. Simulator, PLC
control logic, SQLite logger, and Next.js dashboard are all complete, committed,
and verified together. Next.js bumped 14.2 -> 16.2 / React 18 -> 19 to clear 4
security advisories; required async-API migrations (`serverExternalPackages`,
async dynamic-route `params`) applied. `start_all.sh` / `stop_all.sh` added so
the whole stack comes up with one command.

Integration test (`/tmp/integration_test.py`, throwaway) ran the brief's
sweep 3000 -> 4000 -> 5000 -> 6100 -> 4000 RPM via OpenPLC's slave port 502
(operator writes go to `%QW100`-`%QW103`, not directly to the sim's holding
registers, because the PLC mirrors its own variables down to the sim every scan
and would overwrite direct writes). Results:

| Setpoint | Avg RPM (last 5s) | Steady err | Limiter? | OVERSPEED? |
|---------:|------------------:|-----------:|:--------:|:----------:|
| 3000     | 4236.0            | +1236.0    | no       | no         |
| 4000     | 4238.4            | +238.4     | no       | no         |
| 5000     | 5019.6            | +19.6      | no       | no         |
| 6100     | 6038.6            | -61.4      | **yes**  | no         |
| 4000     | 4244.8            | +244.8     | no       | no         |

- OK: OVERSPEED_TRIP (6500) never fired; max observed RPM 6106.
- OK: Limiter fired only at the 6100 setpoint step (34 of 1337 samples that run).
- NOTE: **Physical floor at ~4236 RPM.** With the brake at 100% the dyno cannot
  pull the engine below ~4236 RPM at full throttle — engine torque exceeds max
  brake torque at lower RPMs. The 3000/4000 setpoints in the brief are below
  this floor and saturate. The 5000 RPM step tracks within 20 RPM, which is
  the realistic working band.

**Known bug surfaced during integration:** the logger's default `--db`
is `data/dyno.db` *relative to CWD*, and the dashboard reads
`<cwd>/../data/dyno.db`. If the logger is launched from `logger/` they end up
on different files. `start_all.sh` runs the logger from the repo root so both
land on `data/dyno.db`. If you ever start the logger by hand, cd to the repo
root first (or pass `--db /home/ubuntu/projects/lo206-dyno/data/dyno.db`).

Immediate next step: write up the project (blog/docs) and prep the demo
presentation. Future calibration: tune J_ENGINE / cut-duration so per-cut RPM
drop at the limiter approaches the ~800 RPM real-world target.
Blocking questions: None.
